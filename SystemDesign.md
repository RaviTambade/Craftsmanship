# System Design

A strong foundation in system design is an indispensable asset for advancing your career, irrespective of your engineering specialisation. It serves as a pivotal key to success not only in interviews but also in your professional journey.

Becoming an expert in system design is a gradual, enriching process, fueled by hands on experience. Remember, it's not just about reaching a destination but appreciating the journey itself. Persistence, an openminded approach, and an unwavering commitment to continuous learning will ultimately lead you to master the art of system design.

Essential Steps to adopt for System Design:

1. <b>Define Functional and NonFunctional Requirements</b>:
  Identify and meticulously document the functional requirements (what the system should accomplish) and non-functional requirements (how the system should perform).

2. <b>Understand Your Users and Their Behaviour</b>:
  Gain insights into the system's users, their behaviour, and their needs.
  Consider factors such as user demographics, types, usage patterns, and expectations.

3. <b>Shape the Data Model and Storage</b>
  Create a comprehensive data model that encompasses the data schema.
  Choose the most suitable database type (SQL, NoSQL, distributed stores, or graph databases).
  Strategise how data will be stored, retrieved, and updated efficiently.

4. <b>Craft API Design and Communication</b>:
  Define the API endpoints and communication methods for interactions within the system and with external systems.
  Pay meticulous attention to API contracts, request/response formats, synchronous vs. asynchronous communication, and the selection of communication protocols (REST, SOAP, GraphQL).

5. <b>Identify Core Components</b>:
  Pinpoint the major components within your system, including core services, databases, load balancers, CDNs, DNS, caching layers, and any external services or APIs your system connects with.
   
6. <b>Envision the HighLevel Architecture</b>:
  Develop a high level architectural diagram that visually depicts the components and their interactions with core services.
  Understand how data flows throughout the system and how services communicate.

7.<b> Dive into Low-Level Design</b>:
  Delve deep into the low level design specifics for each major component.
  Define data structures, algorithms, and implementation particulars.
  Contemplate optimisation techniques, tradeoffs, and potential bottlenecks.
