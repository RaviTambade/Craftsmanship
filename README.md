### Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship
Raising the bar.
As a aspiring Software Craftsmen we are raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft. Through this work we have come to value:
- Not only working software, but also well-crafted software
- Not only responding to change,but also steadily adding value
- Not only individuals and interactions,but also a community of professionals
- Not only customer collaboration,but also productive partnerships
- That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the right to be indispensable.

<p>It is Agile. 
It is beautiful.
I am loving it.
