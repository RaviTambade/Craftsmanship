# Craftmanship
Design Principles, Design Principles, Software Architecture


### What Do Software Developers Do?
*   Software developers write code to turn manual processes into automated processes.
*   Everything the program is supposed to do must be known by the software developer.

## Crafting Solution

Crafting Software guides you into a process that will help you resolve both of these challenges by showing you effective ways to capture the appropriate details using specific artifacts and user stories.

Crafting Software will have a strong focus on learning OOP principles and design patterns and more, but always with a focus of why we might choose one design over another. We will always focus on applying designs as a way forward in creating working software. We will only move forward with designs after we understand why we’ve chosen a specific way forward while understanding the trade-offs we’ve chosen.

The things we will learn about in Crafting Software will help you as you create software systems of every kind.


Crafting Software will help you as you create software systems of every kind.

Here’s a list of some of the things we will cover (there will be far more in the completed book):

 Requirements: What Do They Mean to Developers?
I thought the BA (Business Analyst) would provide these. (Insert maniacal laughter of experienced software developer here.)
How can I get people to tell me what they really want?
Is there an easy way to get a summary of the system?
How can I easily track requirements (since no one else is)?
Real Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
OOP Is For Humans, Processors Don’t Care (OOP is a way to organize your code)
SOLID Principles
The Power of Flexible Design Using Interfaces
Writing Less Code Means You’re Advancing
Read Your Code Like a Book - readable source means less docs.
Code Reuse: The Holy Grail!
Handle Errors Because You Know About Them
TDD, BDD - Building quality into the design
Code coverage - touch all your code & know what hasn’t been touched
Patterns of Software Development
New ways to think about patterns -- so many devs think of these as some kind of magic written about in the GoF (Gang of Four Design Patterns book). Here you will learn the why of patterns.
Reusable OOP structures which help you quickly solve problems and communicate solutions to other developers MVC - Heavy emphasis on Separation of Concerns (SoC) in modern software
Real Software Design
The real way forward : decomposing requirements (user stories) into domain model classes
Sticky note method: nouns and verbs
Database As A Developer
What is the point of a relational database? Answer: Structure
Basic DB Design, Connection, etc
Repository Pattern
Tools to make you faster
Roundhouse
Localdb (Microsoft “file” database)
Special section on Sqlite
Version Control (Mercurial or Git)
VCS (Version Control System) is non-negotiable for professional devs It’s not overhead, good VCS is a developer’s best friend
Enterprise Patterns
Reusable system structures which help you solve Enterprise challenges
Integrating solutions - One of the main challenges is that data is stored in disparate formats and yet the Enterprise needs to share certain data elements with various systems
Deliverables / Milestones
Working software (Minimum Viable Product (MVP))
continuous delivery and the necessity of tooling (build & deploy)
Appropriate UML Docs
You will have to explain things to other people in various roles. This is how you choose the appropriate document to show the person.
Highest level of abstraction first, drill down into detail only as necessary - speeds up communication, makes meetings faster!
You must use the language of the business domain. You must get everyone to use the same language (ubiquitous language) so that everyone can talk about things the same way.
These UML docs will help create our Software Development Map
Best software for creating UML - Enterprise Architect -- non-negotiable if you’re a professional dev
Also provides nice code reverse engineering and code generating
Every UML document explained with a why -- why you should produce the document
A large portion of developers do not know why they create these documents. After you read Crafting Software you will be able to produce and explain every UML document covered and defend your reasons for not creating specific documents should you decide not to.
