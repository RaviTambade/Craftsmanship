## What Do Software Developers Do?
*   Software developers write code to turn manual processes into automated processes.
*   Everything the program is supposed to do must be known by the software developer.

## What Do Software Developers Really Need?
There are a few things that every software developer needs.

- A basic starting point - what are the basics of what we are supposed to build?
- A way forward - how should the code be created?
- A way to continue - A basic process for the daily work the software developer will do
- A way backward - what did we actually do to create the software?
  - Examples of things you might need to know as you look backward:
    - Configuration - so you can deploy
    - OOP Design -- so you can add enhancements, or more easily determine why a bug is occurring
    - DB Schema -- so you know where data is stored, for examination
Etc.

## Crafting Software

Crafting Software is a process that shows you effective ways to capture the appropriate requirement details of a needed Software System using specific artifacts and user stories.

Crafting Software  focus on
- Software Design Principles
- Software Architectures
- OOP(Object Oriented Paradigm)
- Design Patterns and Practices 

Some important Learning Expereinces of Software Crafting:
- Requirements: What Do They Mean to Developers?
  - I thought the BA (Business Analyst) would provide these.
- How can I get people to tell me what they really want?
- Is there an easy way to get a summary of the system?
- Real Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - OOP Is For Humans, Processors Don’t Care (OOP is a way to organize your code)
  - Hollywood, YAGNI, DRY, KISS, SOLID Design Principles
- The Power of Flexible Design Using Interfaces
- Writing Less Code Means You’re Advancing
- Read Your Code Like a Book - readable source means less docs.
- Code Reuse: The Holy Grail!
- Handle Errors Because You Know About Them
- TDD, BDD - Building quality into the design
  - Code coverage - touch all your code & know what hasn’t been touched
- Patterns of Software Development
  -New ways to think about patterns -- so many devs think of these as some kind of magic written about in the GoF (Gang of Four Design Patterns book).
  - Reusable OOP structures which help you quickly solve problems and communicate solutions to other developers
- Real Software Design
  - The real way forward : decomposing requirements (<b>user stories</b>) into domain model classes
  - Sticky note method: nouns and verbs
- Database As A Developer
  - What is the point of a relational database? Answer: Structure
  - Basic DB Design, Connection, etc.
  - Repository Pattern
  - Tools to make you faster
    - MySql
    - MongoDB
- Version Control (Git or SVN)
    - VCS (Version Control System) is non-negotiable for professional devs 
    - It’s not overhead, good VCS is a developer’s best friend
- Enterprise Patterns
    - Reusable system structures which help you solve Enterprise challenges
- Integrating solutions 
    - One of the main challenges is that data is stored in disparate formats and yet the Enterprise needs to share certain data elements with various systems
- Deliverables / Milestones
- Working software (<b>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</b>)
- Continuous Integration/Continous delivery (<b>CI/CD</b>) and the necessity of tooling (build & deploy)
- Appropriate UML Docs
    - You will have to explain things to other people in various roles. 
    - This is how you choose the appropriate document to show the person.
    - Highest level of abstraction first, drill down into detail only as necessary 
        - speeds up communication, makes meetings faster!
    - You must use the language of the business domain. 
        - You must get everyone to use the same language (ubiquitous language) so that everyone can talk about things the same way.
    - These UML docs will help create our Software Development Map
    - Best software for creating UML 
        - Enterprise Architect -- non-negotiable if you’re a professional dev
        - Also provides nice code reverse engineering and code generating
- Every UML document explained with a why -- why you should produce the document
    - A large portion of developers do not know why they create these documents. 

Crafting Software process helps to produce and explain every UML document covered 

## Always remember "Working software is the primary measure of progress".
