<img src="/Images/learning.png">
<b>Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.</b> <br/>
Software is a beautiful master piece crafted by Software Development Team.<br/> Crafting Software is an art of making software.It is a learning expereince of building working software in a better way. 
It is Agile; It is beautiful. 
I am loving it.

### What Do Software Developers Do?
Let me share with you. IT automation is the process of creating software to replace repeatable processes and reduce manual intervention. It is the process of accelerating the delivery of IT infrastructure and applications. IT automation is Software Development.It is not a Rocket science. 
*   Software developers write code to turn manual processes into automated processes.
*   Everything the program is supposed to do must be known by the software developer.

### What Do Software Developers Really Need?
The journey from idea to masterpiece is paved with trust, hard work and sprinkled with passion. There are a few things that every software developer needs.

- A basic entry point - what are the basics of what we are supposed to build?
- A way forward - how should the code be created?
- A way to continue - A basic process for the daily work the software developer will do
- A way backward - what did we actually do to create the software?
  - Examples of things you might need to know as you look backward:
    - Configuration - so you can deploy
    - OOP Design -- so you can add enhancements, or more easily determine why a bug is occurring
    - DB Schema -- so you know where data is stored, for examination
Etc.

### Crafting Software  focus on
- Software Design Principles
- Software Architectures
- OOP(Object Oriented Paradigm)
- Design Patterns and Practices 

### Some important Learning Expereinces of Software Crafting:
- Requirements: What Do They Mean to Developers?
  - I thought the BA (Business Analyst) would provide these.
- How can I get people to tell me what they really want?
- Is there an easy way to get a summary of the system?
- Real Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - OOP Is For Humans, Processors Don’t Care (OOP is a way to organize your code)
  - Hollywood, YAGNI, DRY, KISS, SOLID Design Principles
- The Power of Flexible Design Using Interfaces
- Writing Less Code Means You’re Advancing
- Read Your Code Like a Book - readable source means less docs.
- Code Reuse: The Holy Grail!
- Handle Errors Because You Know About Them
- TDD, BDD - Building quality into the design
  - Code coverage - touch all your code & know what hasn’t been touched
- Patterns of Software Development
  -New ways to think about patterns -- so many devs think of these as some kind of magic written about in the GoF (Gang of Four Design Patterns book).
  - Reusable OOP structures which help you quickly solve problems and communicate solutions to other developers
- Real Software Design
  - The real way forward : decomposing requirements (<b>user stories</b>) into domain model classes
  - Sticky note method: nouns and verbs
- Database As A Developer
  - What is the point of a relational database? Answer: Structure
  - Basic DB Design, Connection, etc.
  - Repository Pattern
  - Tools to make you faster
    - MySql
    - MongoDB
- Version Control (Git or SVN)
    - VCS (Version Control System) is non-negotiable for professional devs 
    - It’s not overhead, good VCS is a developer’s best friend
- Enterprise Patterns
    - Reusable system structures which help you solve Enterprise challenges
- Integrating solutions 
    - One of the main challenges is that data is stored in disparate formats and yet the Enterprise needs to share certain data elements with various systems
- Deliverables / Milestones
- Working software (<b>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</b>)
- Continuous Integration/Continous delivery (<b>CI/CD</b>) and the necessity of tooling (build & deploy)
- Appropriate UML Docs
    - You will have to explain things to other people in various roles. 
    - This is how you choose the appropriate document to show the person.
    - Highest level of abstraction first, drill down into detail only as necessary 
        - speeds up communication, makes meetings faster!
    - You must use the language of the business domain. 
        - You must get everyone to use the same language (ubiquitous language) so that everyone can talk about things the same way.
    - These UML docs will help create our Software Development Map
    - Best software for creating UML 
        - Enterprise Architect -- non-negotiable if you’re a professional dev
        - Also provides nice code reverse engineering and code generating
- Every UML document explained with a why -- why you should produce the document
    - A large portion of developers do not know why they create these documents. 

Crafting Software process helps to produce and explain every UML document covered 

### Always remember "Working software is the primary measure of progress".

## Running the Examples
Each Example is separated into its own folder on the repository. It has its own solution. Browse the repository, each solution can be built separately with dotnet build or run with dotnet run.
