A computer server is a powerful, big computer providing data to other computers. A server does not have a keyboard or a screen. You may have your computer with data and files that you have key-in, it is a server that stores the required data and shares the information with you anytime you access it. Your server may serve data on a LAN (local area network) to systems or a WAN (wide area network) over the internet.

A server is a hardware or software device accepting and responding to your requests made over a network. Commonly, it refers to the computer system receiving requests for files and sends the same to the clients.

# Five fundamental server types:

- <b>Web Server</b>
    - <b>Website Hosting</b>: Web servers store and deliver web content, making websites accessible globally.
    - <b>Web Applications</b>: They host and run web applications, like online shopping carts or social networks.
    - <b>Load Balancing</b>: Web servers distribute traffic across multiple servers for scalability.

- <b>Mail Server</b>
    - <b>Email Delivery</b>: Mail servers send, receive, and store email messages, ensuring efficient communication.
    - <b>Spam Filtering</b>: They filter and block unsolicited emails (spam) from reaching your inbox.
    - <b>Collaborative Work</b>: Mail servers are the backbone of collaborative email platforms for businesses and organizations.

- <b>DNS Server</b>
    - <b>Domain Resolution</b>: DNS servers resolve domain names into IP addresses, enabling your browser to find websites.
    - <b>Load Balancing</b>: They distribute traffic among multiple servers, improving website performance.
    - <b>Security</b>: DNS servers help detect and prevent cyber threats by filtering malicious domain requests.

- <b>Proxy Server</b>
Proxy servers can hide your IP address and provide anonymous browsing.
    - <b>Content Filtering</b>: They filter content, enabling parental controls or restricting access to certain websites.
    - <b>Caching</b>: Proxy servers cache web content, speeding up access and reducing bandwidth usage.
- <b>FTP Server</b>
    - <b>File Transfer</b>: FTP servers facilitate file transfer between computers, critical for businesses.
    - <b>Data Backup</b>: They serve as secure destinations for data backups, ensuring data redundancy.
    - <b>Website Management</b>: FTP servers allow web developers to upload and maintain website files.

- <b>Original Server </b>
    - <b>Data Management</b>: Original servers store master databases, ensuring data integrity.
    - <b>Web Hosting</b>: They host primary website content, applications, and services.
    - <b>Content Source</b>: In content delivery networks (CDNs), they store the original content for distribution.

These server types are the building blocks of our digital world, powering websites, emails, data storage, and so much more. Understanding their use cases is key to harnessing the full potential of technology.
