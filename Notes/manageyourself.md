# 9 months are over in 2023

Do these for 60 days to become unrecognizable next 2 months


### 1.Manage  Your Time.
You are not Overwhelmed, You are Unorganized.
- Wake up Earlier
- Create To-Do-list
- Set Deadlines
- Stick to your Schedule


### 2.Focus On one Thing.
- Everybody wants results, but nobody wants to stay focused
- The gap between your current life and the life your want is called Focus.
- Focus 100% on One thing, instead of doing 5 things with 20% focus each.

### 3.Make Gradual Improvements.
You can't go to the level 10 with level 1 habits
- Start by reading one page
- Start by writing one paragraph
- Start by doing one Workout
- Start today
Then focus of on getting 1% better everyday.
Minor improvements over time leads to big changes.

### 4.Look At Things Diagnostically.
Instead of focusing on Negative, ask yourself:
- What am I in control of?
- Start by writing one paragraph
- Start by doing one Workout
- Start today
Then focus of on getting 1% better everyday.
Minor improvements over time leads to big changes.
