## **“Becoming a System Designer”**

> “Dear Students,
> Let me take you on a journey — not just to learn *System Design*, but to understand why it’s the soul of building real-world software.

Imagine you're building your dream city — roads, traffic signals, schools, power plants, and homes. Every piece has to work not just by itself, but *together*, smoothly and efficiently. That, my friends, is exactly what system design is — *engineering harmony in software*.

And whether you’re a backend developer, frontend designer, DevOps engineer, or architect — **system design will shape your decisions, your creativity, and your impact**.

## 🏁 Step 1: **Define Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**

📌 *Story:*
Imagine you're asked to build an online exam system. What's the first thing you’ll ask?

> “Sir, what should this system do?”

Exactly! That’s where you start.

* ✅ **Functional requirements**: Allow students to register, appear for exams, evaluate results.
* ⚙️ **Non-functional requirements**: Should handle 10,000 concurrent users, ensure no student sees someone else’s question, and auto-submit after timeout.

🎯 **Lesson:**
Before building anything, understand **what** and **how well** it must function.

## 👥 Step 2: **Understand Your Users and Their Behaviour**

📌 *Story:*
You’re building Instagram. Who are your users? Teens, influencers, marketers — each with different expectations.

You need to ask:

* How often do they log in?
* Are they mobile or web users?
* What time do they use the app the most?

🎯 **Lesson:**
A good system isn’t just functional — it’s tuned to real user behaviour. Design **for people**, not just requirements.

## 🧩 Step 3: **Shape the Data Model and Choose the Right Storage**

📌 *Story:*
Let’s say you're designing a library management system. You list entities: Books, Authors, Students, Issues.

Now think:

* Are these relationships complex?
* Do I need joins? → Use **Relational DB**.
* Am I storing user logs or chat messages? → Consider **NoSQL**.
* Do I need high-speed key lookups? → Try **Redis**.

🎯 **Lesson:**
Your **data model is the skeleton** of your system. Choose your database like a doctor chooses a treatment — based on exact needs.

## 📡 Step 4: **Craft API Design and Communication**

📌 *Story:*
You’re now building the bridge — **APIs** — between frontend and backend.

Define:

* `GET /students`
* `POST /exam/submit`
* `GET /result/{id}`

Then ask:

* Should I use **REST** or **GraphQL**?
* Should this call be **synchronous** (user waits) or **asynchronous** (background task)?
* Should I use **JSON or Protocol Buffers**?

🎯 **Lesson:**
A great API is like a **clear conversation** — no misunderstandings, well-documented, predictable, and fast.

## 🧱 Step 5: **Identify Core Components**

📌 *Story:*
Now, imagine the system like a building. What do you need?

* App Servers (logic)
* Databases (storage)
* Load Balancer (traffic manager)
* CDN (faster image delivery)
* Cache (quick data access)
* DNS (name-to-IP mapping)

🎯 **Lesson:**
Every software system is a set of smart building blocks. Know them well and connect them wisely.

## 🗺️ Step 6: **Envision the High-Level Architecture**

📌 *Story:*
You sketch a **bird’s-eye view** diagram on a whiteboard:
Clients → API Gateway → Load Balancer → App Servers → DB

Add:

* Arrows showing data flow.
* Where you’ll cache data.
* Where logs are stored.
* How you’ll handle failures.

🎯 **Lesson:**
Before writing a single line of code, **visualize your architecture**. If you can explain it to a friend, you're on the right path.

## 🔬 Step 7: **Dive into Low-Level Design**

📌 *Story:*
Zoom into one component — say, the **Exam Timer**.

Ask:

* What data structures will I use? Queue? HashMap?
* What algorithms? Auto-submit on timeout?
* What if two requests come at the same time?

This is where you solve edge cases, design classes, write pseudocode, and consider **trade-offs** (performance vs memory, latency vs accuracy).

🎯 **Lesson:**
Low-level design is the **craftsmanship** of system design — where the real problem-solving happens.

## 🎓 Mentor’s Final Thought:

> “System Design is not a subject — it’s a way of thinking.
> It’s what turns a developer into an engineer.
> So, dear student — start sketching, building, debugging.
> Ask more ‘what if?’ questions. And always think like an architect building for tomorrow.”
